## Project 1 : Interpret a Data Visualization




.



> A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others.



.


We practice with this, by selected  one Tableau dashboards for you to explore. I choose to work with the **LinkedIn  Dashboard**  so I:




- Find three insights in the visualizations.


-  For each insight, I provide a static image that shares what you found.



-  Write a short report explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard. Altogether  and included some  images.

The Fundamentals file provides the fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. The Securities file provided the industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index.
